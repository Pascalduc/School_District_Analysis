# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 assignment
## Overview of the school district analysis
In this analysis, we help Maria review student scores for the school board. After evidence of academic dishonesty were suspected, we removed all scores for Thomas High School (THS) 9th grade students and re-analyzed the data.
## Results
First, we used the `loc` method to locate and replace all grade 9 math and reading scores from THS students using the imported module numpy and the `np.nan` function.  
```
student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df['school_name'] == 'Thomas High School')
                    & (student_data_df['grade'] == '9th'),'reading_score'] = np.nan
```
The dataframe was reassembled with the new data and we confirmed `NaN` appeared in the select cells in the district summary.
### Student data

In order to recalculate averages, we removed the 9th grade THS students from our total count and continued with further analysis. 
### District summary
![district_summary](Resources/ district_summary.png)
The district summary was not greatly affected by the suppression of THS 9th grade scores with at most 0.3% change.
### School summary
For the school summary, THS scores for math and reading were again minimally affect but the % passing was much lower by ~25% if we did not replace the value with the new student count. After adjusting the total student count these % passing values were not changed much.

### Bottom schools

Overall, the ranking for Thomas High School was not modified after removing the scores for 9th grade and THS remained in second place.
### Math score

### Reading scores
![reading_by_grade](Resources/ reading_by_grade.png)
In the score by grades table the major difference is that there is no average calculated for THS 9th grade students and therefore `NaN` is displayed.
### Scores by school spending
![spending_summary](Resources/ spending_summary.png)
Looking at the scores by school spending, these is also no significant differences after the new analysis. 
### Scores by school size
![size_summary](Resources/ size_summary.png)
The same no difference result was observed in the score by school size table. 
### Scores by school type
![ type_summary](Resources/ type_summary.png)
In the school type summary, no difference can be observed.
## Summary
To summarize, removing THS 9th grade scores did not affect the overall averages and rankings. This is because only 461 scores out of 39 170 were remove. This represents only about ~1.2% of the total students in the district. The important thing is to adjust our student count to exclude those with no scores. If there was confirmed academic dishonesty, it most likely was minimal and did not affect any results.
